This is a new release. I have read and agree to the the
CRAN policies at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

This is a re-submission of the first version of this package. I have
now described in more detail what the package is in the Description
field of the DESCRIPTION file. In addition, there are now examples
outside of \dontrun{} for every function.

Thanks!
Scott Chamberlain
