#' You may have to ask for access for one or more IP addresses you'll be
#' accessing BASE from, but you may not. It used to be the case, but now seems
#' like it's not IP restricted anymore. If you aren't able to access this API
#' you can request access at https://www.base-search.net/about/en/contact.php
